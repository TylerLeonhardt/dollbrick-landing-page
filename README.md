There's no build steps! It's all pure JS importing React on the fly.

* Clone the repo
* Host the server:
  * Node: `npx serve public/` (run in a terminal)
  * Python: `cd public; python3 -m http.server 8080` (run in a terminal)
  * VS Code:
    * Install the [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) extension
    * Open the Command Palette (F1) and run the command `Live Preview: Start Server`
* Open the url that gets spit out in your browser
